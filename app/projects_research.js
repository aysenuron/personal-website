    longDescription: `How do people inhabit spaces designed for them by governing institutions? My thesis explored this question through ethnographic research in Yukarıköy, a Yörük village in Çanakkale, Turkey, where 166 houses were rebuilt by the state's Housing Development Administration (TOKİ) following destructive earthquakes in 2017. While TOKİ's urban transformation projects are widely documented, their rural interventions remain underexplored. Through fieldwork spanning multiple visits between 2020-2022, I examined how the state's vision of "modernizing" rural life intersected with villagers' actual practices—revealing how inhabitants both adapt to and reshape strategically planned environments through everyday tactics.`,

        items: [
          `**The Production of "Customer-Citizens":** Unlike TOKİ's profit-driven urban projects that displace residents, Yukarıköy's earthquake houses weren't built for financial gain. However, the neoliberal logic remained: villagers became long-term debtors paying installments to the state over 20 years, transforming inhabitants into customer-citizens even without displacement.`,
          "**Spatial Tactics Within Strategic Design:** Residents immediately began adapting their new homes—building stone ovens for traditional bread-making, constructing outdoor toilets despite two indoor bathrooms, adding one-room houses for elderly parents, and converting porches into carpet-weaving workshops. These weren't acts of resistance but inventive tactics for continuing valued practices within new spatial constraints.",
          `**Historical Continuity:** Comparing Yukarıköy to projects from Sample Villages (1920s-30s) through Village Institutes (1940s) revealed consistent patterns: the state repeatedly attempts to "modernize" rural citizens through architectural intervention, while inhabitants consistently find ways to make spaces work for them rather than adapting entirely to prescribed uses.`,

        items: [
          "**Users as Active Producers:** Yukarıköy demonstrates that people don't simply accept designed systems—they adapt, modify, and work around them. Digital designers face similar realities: users develop workarounds, repurpose features, and create use cases designers never imagined.",
          "**Power and Equity in Design:** Who decides how systems should work? My research examined how institutional power shapes environments, but also how inhabitants push back. Understanding these dynamics is essential for creating more equitable digital systems.",
          "**Context Over Standardization:** TOKİ applied standardized approaches used since Ottoman-era village projects, ignoring local practices. The result required costly adaptation by both state and citizens. In UX, understanding specific contexts and community needs must drive design decisions rather than one-size-fits-all solutions.",
          "**Ethnography as Design Tool:** Observing how villagers transformed their spaces revealed needs that surveys would miss. Ethnographic methods—watching behavior in context, understanding workarounds, documenting adaptations—uncover actual user needs rather than assumed ones.",

      `This research was deeply personal—Yukarıköy is close to where I'm from in Çanakkale. The saying "write what you know" took on new meaning as I studied a place I thought I understood but came to know in entirely new depth through this work.`,
      `Being from the region mattered. The villagers already knew me or my family, which transformed what could have been formal interviews into shared meals, tea, and genuine conversations. I even attended a wedding there. This insider perspective was crucial—when academics discuss Yörük villages, there's often an undertone of pity or romanticization, assumptions about rural poverty. But I knew these villagers aren't poor. They do agriculture, animal husbandry, run carpet-weaving businesses. They have resources and agency. My research approach refused both pity and romanticization, instead focusing on how people with clear intentions and capabilities navigate state-imposed systems.`,
      `Yukarıköy taught me that good design isn't about controlling use—it's understanding the relationship between what's provided and what's practiced, between strategic design and tactical adaptation.`,

The removals weren't failures; they were valuable data about who controls urban memory. Shop owners who remembered their buildings as cinemas became collaborators, contributing stories we never would have found otherwise.",
      'Unlike apps that require downloads or websites that need searching, the stickers worked because people stumbled upon them during their daily routines. **Creating "findable" rather than "searchable"** information—designing interventions that meet people where they already are—has shaped how I think about location-based design ever since.',

Created during a workshop at İyi Tasarım (Good Design İzmir), İzmir's annual design week featuring workshops, panels, and public interventions, this project aimed to restore visibility to the cultural heritage lost in the 1922 fire that destroyed much of the city's pre-fire urban fabric.`,

          "After the fire, **the destroyed area was gradually transformed into Kültürpark** in the 1930s—a massive public park that erased the previous street grid and settlement patterns. Today, few traces remain of the cosmopolitan neighborhoods that once thrived here. The churches, synagogues, houses, shops, and streets that made up pre-fire İzmir exist now only in photographs and memories.",

The installation didn't just tell people about Aya Katerina; it required them to physically position themselves, to search for the right angle, to discover the church for themselves.`,
