    longDescription: `How do people inhabit spaces designed for them by governing institutions? My thesis explored this question through ethnographic research in Yukarıköy, a Yörük village in Çanakkale, Turkey, where 166 houses were rebuilt by the state's Housing Development Administration (TOKİ) following destructive earthquakes in 2017. While TOKİ's urban transformation projects are widely documented, their rural interventions remain underexplored. Through fieldwork spanning multiple visits between 2020-2022, I examined how the state's vision of "modernizing" rural life intersected with villagers' actual practices—revealing how inhabitants both adapt to and reshape strategically planned environments through everyday tactics.`,

        items: [
          `**The Production of "Customer-Citizens":** Unlike TOKİ's profit-driven urban projects that displace residents, Yukarıköy's earthquake houses weren't built for financial gain. However, the neoliberal logic remained: villagers became long-term debtors paying installments to the state over 20 years, transforming inhabitants into customer-citizens even without displacement.`,
          "**Spatial Tactics Within Strategic Design:** Residents immediately began adapting their new homes—building stone ovens for traditional bread-making, constructing outdoor toilets despite two indoor bathrooms, adding one-room houses for elderly parents, and converting porches into carpet-weaving workshops. These weren't acts of resistance but inventive tactics for continuing valued practices within new spatial constraints.",
          `**Historical Continuity:** Comparing Yukarıköy to projects from Sample Villages (1920s-30s) through Village Institutes (1940s) revealed consistent patterns: the state repeatedly attempts to "modernize" rural citizens through architectural intervention, while inhabitants consistently find ways to make spaces work for them rather than adapting entirely to prescribed uses.`,

        heading: "Connecting This Research to My Design Practice",
        items: [
          "**Users as Active Producers:** Yukarıköy demonstrates that people don't simply accept designed systems—they adapt, modify, and work around them. Digital designers face similar realities: users develop workarounds, repurpose features, and create use cases designers never imagined.",
          "**Power and Equity in Design:** Who decides how systems should work? My research examined how institutional power shapes environments, but also how inhabitants push back. Understanding these dynamics is essential for creating more equitable digital systems.",
          "**Context Over Standardization:** TOKİ applied standardized approaches used since Ottoman-era village projects, ignoring local practices. The result required costly adaptation by both state and citizens. In UX, understanding specific contexts and community needs must drive design decisions rather than one-size-fits-all solutions.",
          "**Ethnography as Design Tool:** Observing how villagers transformed their spaces revealed needs that surveys would miss. Ethnographic methods—watching behavior in context, understanding workarounds, documenting adaptations—uncover actual user needs rather than assumed ones.",

      `This research was deeply personal—Yukarıköy is close to where I'm from in Çanakkale. The saying "write what you know" took on new meaning as I studied a place I thought I understood but came to know in entirely new depth through this work.`,
      `Being from the region mattered. The villagers already knew me or my family, which transformed what could have been formal interviews into shared meals, tea, and genuine conversations. I even attended a wedding there. This insider perspective was crucial—when academics discuss Yörük villages, there's often an undertone of pity or romanticization, assumptions about rural poverty. But I knew these villagers aren't poor. They do agriculture, animal husbandry, run carpet-weaving businesses. They have resources and agency. My research approach refused both pity and romanticization, instead focusing on how people with clear intentions and capabilities navigate state-imposed systems.`,
      `Yukarıköy taught me that good design isn't about controlling use—it's understanding the relationship between what's provided and what's practiced, between strategic design and tactical adaptation.`,

    longDescription: `The project traces the cultural history of movie theaters between 1950-1990 in the historical area currently under protection in Buca. The project is the first phase of a larger research project, and rather than leaning on a discourse of nostalgia for old movie theaters, it aims to address urban memory as an immaterial and active part of the ongoing social production of space.`,

          'The core of the project was a guerrilla mapping intervention: we placed stickers reading "BURADA ESKİDEN SİNEMA VARDI" (There Used to Be a Movie Theater Here) with QR codes on buildings that once housed cinemas. Scanning the code took people to an interactive Google Map showing all former theater locations, with historical photos and stories for each site.',
          "**The stickers themselves became the project.** Some were removed within hours—a bank took theirs down the next day, a grocery store removed it immediately. These removals were as meaningful as the stickers that stayed, revealing tensions around who controls urban memory and which histories are welcome in commercial spaces.",

The stickers became conversation starters, prompting intergenerational exchanges about neighborhood history. Even people who just glanced at them in passing became participants—suddenly aware that the mundane storefront they walked by daily had once been a site of community gathering.",

The project treated urban memory not as something lost but as something continuously produced through everyday interaction with place.",

      "This project happened in August 2021—scorching İzmir heat, still wearing masks indoors at the tail end of COVID. Walking through Buca all day, placing stickers, getting rejected by some shops and welcomed by others, was exhausting but also super fun.",
      "It taught me that effective design doesn't require sophisticated technology—a sticker with a QR code created layers of interaction from passive noticing to active engagement. The removals weren't failures; they were valuable data about who controls urban memory. Shop owners who remembered their buildings as cinemas became collaborators, contributing stories we never would have found otherwise.",
      'Unlike apps that require downloads or websites that need searching, the stickers worked because people stumbled upon them during their daily routines. **Creating "findable" rather than "searchable"** information—designing interventions that meet people where they already are—has shaped how I think about location-based design ever since.',
