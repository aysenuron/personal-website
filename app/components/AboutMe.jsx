              Architect turned developer, crafting digital experiences with
              curiosity, care, and a systems mindset‚Äîalways learning along the
              way.
            </span>
            <br />
            <br />I have both bachelor's and master's degrees in architecture,
            but I found my true calling in the digital world. For three years, I
            worked at Elevate Health Technologies as a digital designer and
            Webflow developer. <br />
            <br />
            Along the way, I've taught myself frontend development and started
            taking on freelance projects building websites for clients. I see
            myself as a generalist. My background in architecture gives me a
            different way to look at digital problems.
            <br />
            <br />
            When I face a challenge, my philosophy is simple: "I'll figure it
            out." And so far, I always have. I don't believe in putting myself
            in one box. I learn quickly and adapt to new situations. Each
            project teaches me something new that I can use in the next one.
            <br />
            <br />
            Outside of work, I enjoy biking through city streets, trying new
            recipes in the kitchen, hiking whenever I can get out of town, and
            taking photos of pelicans (yes, specifically pelicans). Simple joys
            that fuel good work. <br />
            <br />
            Let's work together to create something that looks good and works.
