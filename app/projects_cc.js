      "I started with Daniel Shiffman's Coding Train beginner course, learning p5.js fundamentals through playful experiments. Later, I took Tim Rodenbröker's course, diving deeper into computational design principles. These sketches represent my learning journey—from basic shape manipulation to audio-reactive visualizations and image processing.",

    notes: [
      "These projects live alongside my professional work because they represent a different kind of problem-solving. In healthcare web development, I optimize for clarity and usability. In creative coding, I optimize for surprise and aesthetic discovery.",
      "One of my favorite discoveries was the random() function. There's something magical about introducing controlled chaos into your code—you write the rules, but you don't entirely know what you'll get. Each refresh brings a new variation.",
      "The design process here is completely different from my UX work. In creative coding, you design while coding. You change a parameter, run it, see what happens, adjust. It's immediate, iterative, and playful. The code is both the tool and the canvas.",
      "Making sketches interactive adds another dimension. When the visualization responds to your cursor or clicks, it stops being just something you look at and becomes something you play with. That shift from passive to active viewing changes the entire experience.",
