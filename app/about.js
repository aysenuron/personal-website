        I'm a designer and developer based in İzmir, Turkey, currently working
        in marketing at Elevate Health Technologies, a healthcare technology
        company. I build websites and web applications, create marketing

        My background is in architecture with a focus on social space. That
        training taught me to think about how environments shape behavior -
        questions I now apply to digital design and information architecture.

        Outside my day job, I take on freelance UX design and frontend
        development projects. I'm interested in how design decisions shape user
        behavior, and I'm drawn to projects that require systematic thinking
        about information architecture and user flows.

        I'm currently learning creative coding with p5.js and Processing,
        exploring the intersection between computational design and interactive
        experiences. I also cycle, cook, hike, and photograph pelicans around
        İzmir.
