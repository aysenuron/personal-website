        For the past five years, I've been at Elevate Health Technologies, a
        health tech startup, where I've designed and built the company website,
        created interactive marketing tools with JavaScript, integrated systems
        like HubSpot, and handled everything from web design to analytics
        implementation. I also take on freelance projects, building websites and
        digital experiences for various clients. Working across both design and
        development has given me a holistic approach—how things look, how they
        work, and how people actually use them.

        I hold bachelor's and master's degrees in architecture, with research
        focused on social space. That background shapes how I approach digital
        work: I'm interested in how design mediates interaction, how spaces
        (physical or digital) structure behavior, and how people experience and
        move through systems.

        I'm currently exploring creative coding through p5.js and Processing,
        investigating how computational approaches can create more dynamic,
        generative digital experiences that go beyond standard UI patterns.

        Outside of work, you'll find me cycling around İzmir, experimenting in
