        designer and developer based in İzmir, Turkey, working at at Elevate
        Health Technologies, where I build websites and digital design projects

        My background is in architecture with a Master's focused on social space
        - studying that taught me to think about how space relates to behavior
        and power dynamics.

        I also maintain a freelance practice in UX design and frontend
        development, which lets me work across different industries. In
        parallel, I'm teaching myself creative coding through p5.js—building
        interactive visualizations and audio-reactive design experiments for
        fun.
