        I'm a designer and developer based in İzmir, Turkey, working at at
        Elevate Health Technologies, where I build websites and digital design
        projects for healthcare platforms. My work includes Webflow development,
        HubSpot integrations, A/B testing implementation, and creating marketing
        materials for infusion therapy workflows and specialty medication
        programs.

        My background is in architecture with a Master's focused on social space
        - training that taught me to think about how environments shape behavior
        and power dynamics. I now apply those questions to digital design,
        particularly in healthcare information systems where interface decisions
        directly impact how providers and patients navigate complex medical
        processes.

        Outside my day job, I take on freelance UX design and frontend
        development projects. I'm interested in how design decisions shape user
        behavior, and I'm drawn to projects that require systematic thinking
        about information architecture and user flows.

        I'm also exploring creative coding with p5.js and Processing, building
        audio-reactive visualizations and computational design experiments.
        Outside of work, I cycle, cook, hike, and photograph pelicans around
        İzmir.
