          I have both bachelor's and master's degrees in architecture, but I
          found my true calling in the digital world. For three years, I worked

          Along the way, I've taught myself frontend development and started
          taking on freelance projects building websites for clients. I see
          myself as a generalist.

          At Elevate, I designed and developed the company website using Webflow
          while integrating custom JavaScript for enhanced functionality. I
          connected the site with HubSpot for lead generation and implemented
          GA4 and Google Tag Manager to gather actionable insights. My work
          extended to conducting A/B testing to optimize user engagement and
          creating marketing assets that effectively communicate product value.

          When I face a challenge, my philosophy is simple: "I'll figure it
          out." And so far, I always have. I don't believe in putting myself in
